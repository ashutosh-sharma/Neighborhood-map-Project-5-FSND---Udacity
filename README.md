## Live Project: [![App](https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/round-varieties/60/Rounded_-_High_Ultra_Colour02_-_Maps-32.png)](https://ashutosh-sharma.github.io/Neighborhood-map-Project-5-FSND---Udacity/)
## Project Overview
A single page web-application featuring a map of neighborhood, having functionalities including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

## What I learned?
- How **design patterns** assist in developing a manageable codebase
- How **frameworks** can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a number of utilities for you to use
- Implement **third-party APIs** that provide valuable data sets that can improve the quality of your application.

* [Foursquare API](https://foursquare.com/developers/app/XQ2I0ONGSSVL1DYQYSK2Q0ERIM5ASTRANA5FRG41HTTXVKQB) to fetch data for the eating joints.
* [Knockout Javascript](http://knockoutjs.com/downloads/knockout-3.4.2.js) to bind data.
* [jQuery](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js) (Javascript Library) for easier coding of javascript.
* [Bootstrap](https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css) to make the page responsive.
